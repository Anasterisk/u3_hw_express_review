## Express Review

Lets take our backend and middleware knowledge and put them to some real application, building up a mock version of the API that you used for your P2 in Express


### Requirements

- A functioning Express App with two routes
- Each Route having at least 5 peices of data to Get
- A Screenshot of an ERD created to detail what types of data you are using for your JSON objects


### Bonus!

- Load up your app at localhost:3001, testing your routes in Insomnia or in your Browser
- Create a Script.js file and Fetch the data from your routes (url = localhost:3001/_your_data_), then log it to the console
- You can do this with a React app and Axios if you would like as well!
- Hint - You will need to have CORS installed and set up for this section!

### Bonus II

- We know Console Logs aren't the most exciting thing in the world. Use your JS DOM manipulation, or your React skills to render your data on screen, creating your very first full stack app!
